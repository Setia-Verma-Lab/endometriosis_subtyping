Main Target File Options and Corresponding Input Files:
    Call Biofilter Positions:
        - output: Annotations/{data}_biofilter_genes_rsids.csv (annotates positions with nearest gene)
        - input:  Annotations/{data}_biofilter_input_positions.txt (3-column space-delimited file: CHR ID POS)
    Call Biofilter Genes:
        - output: Annotations/{data}_biofilter_gene_regions.txt
        - input:  Annotations/{data}_biofilter_input_genes.txt (single column list of genes)
    Call Biofilter SNPs:
        - output: Annotations/{data}_biofilter_snps_rsids.csv
        - input:  Annotations/{data}_biofilter_input_snps.txt (single column list of RSIDs)

Note: many of the other workflows incorporate annotations into the Summary files automatically so you may not need to call these targets manually

Gene Annotation Algorithm:
    - If a variant is in a gene, it gets assigned that gene
    - If a variant is between two genes, we assess the following:
        - Is it "close" to either gene given config option?
        - If it is "close" to both, it gets annotated to both with a /
        - If it is only "close" to one, it gets annotated with the "close" gene
        - If it is "close" to neither, it gets annotated to both with a /
